## Experiment Results

## File Name : DatasetName_UsedModel_experimentedMethod.ipynb
### This folder incorporates every ipynb notebook that was used on training.
### You can see the specific training time, and process bars in the output cell.

## Note

### The longest training time we took : 30 hours ( 9 minutes per 1 epoch)(cifar100_pyramidnet200_cutmix)

### tinyimagenet_resnet50_* codes didn't give us ideal results, so we gave a bit of change on augmentation, and run the code on resnet18.
