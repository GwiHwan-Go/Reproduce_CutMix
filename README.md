# Reproduce CutMix algorithm


In this repository,

We are going to reproduce the CutMix algorithm based on the paper "CutMix: Regularization Strategy to Train Strong Classifiers with Localizable Features".

# The Overall Process

1. Introduce problem
2. Motivations
3. Datasets used
4. Main methods
5. tweaks and evaluation

+a ) we will add extra codes to visualise additional details that paper may not have shown.
Above tasks will be done with the code demo.

# Check list

1. data loading [22.5.6]
2. methods (including NNs) [22.5.8]
3. model compilation [22.5.8]
4. loss functions and optimisers [22.5.8]
5. training [ ]
6. tweaks [ ]
7. valuation [ ]

Development Environment & Tools

1. Colab
2. Jupyter notebook
3. Visual Studio Code
4. Github
3. Python
4. Pytorch
